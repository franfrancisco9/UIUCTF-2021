# UIUCTF-2021
Writeups for the UIUCTF 2021 competition. 
First of all would like to congratulate the organizers of the CTF, as this has been one of my favourite CTF's so far.
Very fun and creative challenges, and extremly supportive moderators.

I still very much new to the CTF world and even though I did not solve all the challenges I had aimed for I will be doing writeups for some challenges that in the meanwhile I took the time to solve.

Great description of the competition can be found in the official competition website: <https://uiuc.tf>

I participated in Team FF9 and placed 135 with 659 points.

Any suggestions let me know! Here is my discord *Franfrancisco9 #0105*
